Link to Pill anchors. In cases where 2 pills are referenced (eg. PAY TO PLAY), I've linked to the first, as the second is directly below it. I've also used the pill name (eg. "Percs!"), rather than the anchor link (eg. "Pills#Percs!") to make it easier to find linking articles (via the "What links here" page) for each pill, like what was already done for the "Horf!" pill link

''For tips and strategies on completing achievements, see [[Achievement Tips|achievement tips]].''

'''Achievements''' are unlocked after completing [[Challenge]]s, reaching certain [[completion mark|milestones]], achieving hidden goals, or unlocking certain [[item]]s. In the PC version, every Steam achievement exactly corresponds to one secret in-game, whereas only a handful of secrets are represented by PSN trophies in the Playstation version of the game.

If Isaac is unable to unlock achievements, a small icon of a crossed-out trophy {{no unlocks}} will be displayed below the [[Key]]s counter. Conditions which can disable the ability to unlock achievements include:
* Using a pre-determined [[seed]]. {{dlc|a}} Certain cosmetic and difficulty-increasing [[seed|special seeds]] will still allow unlocks.
* During a [[Challenge]], although the achievement for completing the challenge is unaffected.
* {{dlc|a}} During a [[Daily Challenge]], although the achievement associated with this game mode are unaffected.
* {{dlc|a+}} Playing with any enabled [[mod]] (unless [[Mom]] has been beaten).
* {{dlc|a+}} During [[Victory Lap]]s.
* {{dlc|r}} If the [[Debug Console]] is enabled (unless [[Mom]] has been beaten).

Rebirth has a total of 178 unlockable secrets. {{dlc|a}} [[Afterbirth]] added 98 new secrets, for a total of 276. {{dlc|a+}} [[Afterbirth †]] added 63 new secrets, for a total of 339. {{dlc|a+}} [[Booster Pack #5]] added 64 new secrets, for a total of 403. {{dlc|r}} [[Repentance]] added 234 new secrets, for a total of 637.

At the stats screen, pressing Alt + F2 will sync unlocks with Steam achievements. If Isaac has Steam achievements for secrets that haven't been unlocked in-game, they will be unlocked by doing this.

== PlayStation Trophies ==
{{trophy list}}

== Trivia ==
* Each achievement is color-coded based on the requirements for unlocking their respective secrets:
** Tan: Miscellaneous unlocks
** Tan with blood stain: [[Mom's Heart]]/[[It Lives!]] [[Hard Mode]] unlocks
** Olive-Green: Character unlocks
** Dark Red: Mom's Heart/{{s|Womb}} ending unlocks
** Grey: [[Isaac (Boss)|Isaac]] unlocks
** Black: [[Satan]] unlocks
** Dark Blue: [[??? (Boss)|???]] unlocks
** Purple: [[The Lamb]] unlocks
** Pale Green: {{r|Boss Rush}} unlocks
** Pale Blue: [[Hush]] unlocks
** Orange Yellow: [[Greed Mode]] unlocks
** Orange Yellow with blood stain: [[Greedier mode]] unlocks
** White: [[Delirium]] unlocks
** Red: [[Mega Satan]] unlocks
** Bright Yellow: All [[Hard Mode]] marks (most are tan)/Damageless floor/100% unlocks
** Brighter Yellow: {{machine|Greed Donation Machine|d}} unlocks
** Bluish Purple: [[Challenge]] unlocks
** Dark Green with bloodstain: [[Mother]] unlocks
** Orange: [[The Beast]] unlocks
** Bright Purple: Tainted Character unlocks
* Despite being a Boss Rush unlock for {{c|Lazarus}}, {{i|Missing No.}}'s achievement color is bluish purple, a color normally used for challenge-related unlocks.
* Achievements 37-41 and 83 have a typo on their pop-ups, and read "achieveved".
* {{dlc|a+}} Although not technically an achievement, getting 1000000% for all 3 [[Save File Completion|save files]] will result in a special 3,000,000%!!! [[Savefile Images|graphic on the save file]] selection screen.
** {{dlc|r}} In Repentance, something similar happens when achieving Dead God on all 3 save files.
* {{dlc|a+}} The 5 Nights at Mom's achievement is a reference to [[wikipedia:Five Nights at Freddy's (series)|Five Nights at Freddy's]].
* {{dlc|a+}} The Mr. Resetter achievement may be a reference to Mr. Resetti from the [[wikipedia:Animal Crossing|Animal Crossing]] series.
* {{dlc|a+}} The Something Wicked This Way Comes quote is most likely a reference to the same quote from one of the witches from Shakespeare's play "Macbeth."
* {{dlc|a+}} [[Booster Pack #5]] added 64 secrets. Interestingly, this is a single secret more than Afterbirth+'s original count of 63 secrets. Thus, this update more than doubled the amount of secrets added to the game.
* {{plat|PS4}} {{dlc|a+}} Achievements 340-348 don't exist in the PS4 version, resulting in the content already being "unlocked" even on new save files.


== Bugs ==
{{bug|dlc=r|{{i|Clear Rune}} must be unlocked and collected to attain {{a|!Platinum God!}} and {{a|The Real Platinum God}} despite being a Repentance item. This is due to its ID being unused in Rebirth, thus being in the ID range of Rebirth items.}}
