# Better Horsemen Items (Harbinger Boss Drops)

With a 10% chance to replace t floor boss, the Harbingers spawn pretty regularly... but their item drops suck, replacing a HP or stat upgrade with an orbital. Fine if you like orbitals, boring if you don't.

This mod expands their potential drops. Each Harbinger now has their own pool of potential items.
